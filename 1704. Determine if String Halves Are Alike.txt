1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def halvesAreAlike(self, s: str) -> bool:
        v = 'aeiouAEIOU'  
        l = len(s)
        count = 0 
        for i in range(0,l//2):
            if s[i] in v:
                count+=1
            if s[i+l//2] in v:
                count-=1
        return count==0

Example 1:

Input: s = "book"
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.

Example 2:

Input: s = "textbook"
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.
