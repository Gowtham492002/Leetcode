Harshad Number:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def sumOfTheDigitsOfHarshadNumber(self, x: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in str(x):
            ans +=int(i)
        if x%ans==0:
            return ans
        else:
            return -1

Example 1:

Input: x = 18

Output: 9

Explanation:

The sum of digits of x is 9. 18 is divisible by 9. So 18 is a Harshad number and the answer is 9.

Example 2:

Input: x = 23

Output: -1

Explanation:

The sum of digits of x is 5. 23 is not divisible by 5. So 23 is not a Harshad number and the answer is -1.
