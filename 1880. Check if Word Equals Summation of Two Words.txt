1880. Check if Word Equals Summation of Two Words:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def isSumEqual(self, firstWord: str, secondWord: str, targetWord: str) -> bool:
        fword = ""
        sword = ''
        tword = ''
        for i in firstWord:
            fword+= str(ord(i)-ord('a'))
        for i in secondWord:
            sword+= str(ord(i)-ord('a'))
        for i in targetWord:
            tword+= str(ord(i)-ord('a'))
        return int(fword)+int(sword)==int(tword)

Example 1:

Input: firstWord = "acb", secondWord = "cba", targetWord = "cdb"
Output: true
Explanation:
The numerical value of firstWord is "acb" -> "021" -> 21.
The numerical value of secondWord is "cba" -> "210" -> 210.
The numerical value of targetWord is "cdb" -> "231" -> 231.
We return true because 21 + 210 == 231.

Example 2:

Input: firstWord = "aaa", secondWord = "a", targetWord = "aab"
Output: false
Explanation: 
The numerical value of firstWord is "aaa" -> "000" -> 0.
The numerical value of secondWord is "a" -> "0" -> 0.
The numerical value of targetWord is "aab" -> "001" -> 1.
We return false because 0 + 0 != 1.

Example 3:

Input: firstWord = "aaa", secondWord = "a", targetWord = "aaaa"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The numerical value of firstWord is "aaa" -> "000" -> 0.
The numerical value of secondWord is "a" -> "0" -> 0.
The numerical value of targetWord is "aaaa" -> "0000" -> 0.
We return true because 0 + 0 == 0.
