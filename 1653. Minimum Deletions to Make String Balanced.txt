1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        a_count_left  = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == "a":
                a_count_left +=1
        b_count_right = 0
        res = len(s)
        for c in s:
            if c == "a":
                a_count_left -=1
            res = min(res,b_count_right + a_count_left)
            if c == "b":
                b_count_right+=1
        return res



Example 1:

Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
