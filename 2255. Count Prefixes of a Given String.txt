2255. Count Prefixes of a Given String:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def countPrefixes(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in words:
            l = 0
            r = 0
            flag = True
            while(l<len(i) and l<len(s)):
                if i[l]!=s[r]:
                    flag = False
                    break
                else:
                    l+=1
                    r+=1
            if len(s)<len(i):
                continue
            elif flag:
                res+=1
        return res

Example 1:

Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:
"a", "ab", and "abc".
Thus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.

Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","a"], s = "aa"
Output: 2
Explanation:
Both of the strings are a prefix of s. 
Note that the same string can occur multiple times in words, and it should be counted each time.
