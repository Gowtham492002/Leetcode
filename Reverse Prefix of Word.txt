Reverse Prefix of Word:

CODE:

def reversePrefix(self, word: str, ch: str) -> str:
          
        word_list = list(word)
        l=0
        r=0
        while r<len(word):

            if word_list[r] !=ch:
                r+=1
            else:
                while l < r:
                    word_list[l], word_list[r] = word_list[r], word_list[l]
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1
                break 
        return ''.join(word_list)

Example 1:

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".

Example 2:

Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".

Example 3:

Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
