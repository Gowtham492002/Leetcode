2496. Maximum Value of a String in an Array:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def maximumValue(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        maxi = 0
        for i in strs:
            check = True
            for j in i:
                if j<'0' or j>'9':
                    maxi = max(maxi,len(i))
                    check = False
                    break
            if check:
                maxi = max(maxi,int(i))
        return maxi

            

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["alic3","bob","3","4","00000"]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
- "alic3" consists of both letters and digits, so its value is its length, i.e. 5.
- "bob" consists only of letters, so its value is also its length, i.e. 3.
- "3" consists only of digits, so its value is its numeric equivalent, i.e. 3.
- "4" also consists only of digits, so its value is 4.
- "00000" consists only of digits, so its value is 0.
Hence, the maximum value is 5, of "alic3".

Example 2:

Input: strs = ["1","01","001","0001"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Each string in the array has value 1. Hence, we return 1.
