1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans = -1
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(len(s)-1, i, -1):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    ans = max(ans, j - i - 1)
                    break
        return ans

Example 1:

Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2

Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".

Example 3:

Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
