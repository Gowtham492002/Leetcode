2788. Split Strings by Separator:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def splitWordsBySeparator(self, words: List[str], separator: str) -> List[str]:
        ans = []
        for i in words:
            temp = ''
            for j in i:
                if j==separator and len(temp)!=0:
                    ans.append(temp)
                    temp = ''

                elif j==separator and len(temp)==0:
                    continue
                    
                else:
                    temp+=j
            if len(temp)!=0:
                ans.append(temp)
        return ans


Example 1:

Input: words = ["one.two.three","four.five","six"], separator = "."
Output: ["one","two","three","four","five","six"]
Explanation: In this example we split as follows:

"one.two.three" splits into "one", "two", "three"
"four.five" splits into "four", "five"
"six" splits into "six" 

Hence, the resulting array is ["one","two","three","four","five","six"].

Example 2:

Input: words = ["$easy$","$problem$"], separator = "$"
Output: ["easy","problem"]
Explanation: In this example we split as follows: 

"$easy$" splits into "easy" (excluding empty strings)
"$problem$" splits into "problem" (excluding empty strings)

Hence, the resulting array is ["easy","problem"].

Example 3:

Input: words = ["|||"], separator = "|"
Output: []
Explanation: In this example the resulting split of "|||" will contain only empty strings, so we return an empty array [].
