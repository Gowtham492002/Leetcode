1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        return 1 if s[::-1]==s else 2

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".

Example 3:

Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
