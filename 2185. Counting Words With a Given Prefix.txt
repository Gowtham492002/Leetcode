CODE:

class Solution:
    def prefixCount(self, words: List[str], pref: str) -> int:
        ans=0
        
        for i in words:
            count=0
            for j in range(len(pref)):
                if j<len(i) and i[j]==pref[j]:
                    count+=1
                else:
                    break
            if count == len(pref):
                ans+=1
        return ans
