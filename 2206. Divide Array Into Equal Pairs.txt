2206. Divide Array Into Equal Pairs:

CODE:


class Solution:
    def divideArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        d = {}
        for i in nums:
            if i not in d:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i]+=1
   
        for v in d.values():
            if v%2!=0:
                return False
        return True

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: 
There are 6 elements in nums, so they should be divided into 6 / 2 = 3 pairs.
If nums is divided into the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), and (2, 2), it will satisfy all the conditions.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: 
There is no way to divide nums into 4 / 2 = 2 pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.
