1370. Increasing Decreasing String:

CODE:

class Solution:
    def sortString(self, s: str) -> str:
        d = {}
        l = sorted(set(s))
        res=""
        for i in s:
            if i in d:
                d[i]+=1
            else:
                d[i]=1
        while d:
            for i in l:
                if i in d:
                    if d[i]>0:
                        res+=i
                        d[i]-=1
                    else:
                        del d[i]
            for i in l[::-1]:
                if i in d:
                    if d[i]>0:
                        res+=i
                        d[i]-=1
                    else:
                        del d[i]
       

        return res

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
Output: "abccbaabccba"
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat"
Output: "art"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
